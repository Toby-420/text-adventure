<h1>The Room of the Locked Door</h1>
<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>This is a text adventure game written entirely in C.</p>
<p>It uses pdcurses (Windows version of ncurses) to have multiple sections</p>
<p>There is ASCII art in one window which is a simulation of what the player would see. Currently, only 3 rooms have this</p>
<p>There are 5 rooms. 2 obvious, 3 hidden</p>
<h2>Who worked on this?</h2>
<p>Me and my Dad (who does not have a github account)</p>
<p>I did most of the programming, and my dad helped by providing lots of ideas, ASCII art, and debugging help</p>
<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>cory-nonce.mp3 - [Cory Shepherd] (https://github.com/SicariusAtlas)</p>
<h2>Controls</h2>
<p>The game is entirely controlled by keyboard</p>
<p>Commands are used such as 'move', and 'look' and these are shown at the bottom of the screen</p>
<p>The only thing worth noting is that backspace does not work, so the left arrow key must be used. I cannot fix this with my current knowledge, but I am working on a fix</p>
<h2>System requirements</h2>
<p>Currently, the game uses ~4mb of RAM.
CPU and GPU usage are negligible as well</p>
<p>Using the Windows 10 compatibility troubleshooter, I was able to still run the game all the way back with the Windows 95 layer, so it should work</p>
<h2>GNU/Linux version?</h2>
<p>As I have said with the optimisation, I am going to finish the game for Windows 10, then write a version for GNU/Linux. The game should run under WINE if you wish to use that</p>
<p>Also, if you are able, you can change the code to work for other Operating Systems, and post them on here</p>
<p>I have absolutely no access to an Apple Macintosh computer unless I use my Grandma's old one, so I will have to let somebody else do that for me</p>
<h2>Upcoming features</h2>
<p>Fully implement hidden room</p>
