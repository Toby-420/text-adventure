<h1>The Room of the Locked Door</h1>
<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>This is a text adventure game written entirely in C.</p>
<p>It uses pdcurses (Windows version of ncurses) to have multiple windows</p>
<p>There is ASCII art in one window which is a simulation of what the player would see. Currently, only 3 rooms have this</p>
<p>There are 5 rooms. 2 obvious, 3 hidden</p>
<h2>Who worked on this?</h2>
<p>Me and my Dad (who does not have a github account)</p>
<p>I did most of the programming, and my dad helped by providing lots of ideas, ASCII art, debugging help and cans of Sanpellegrino</p>

<h2>How often will updates be posted?</h2>
<p>Possibly every week, but I will try for at least 1 per month</p>
<h2>Where can I donate?</h2>
<p>I currently have no way for donations, and that is fine because having people use my software and talking about it to others is more than enough :)</p>
<h2>Controls</h2>
<p>The game is entirely controlled by keyboard</p>
<p>Commands are used such as 'move', and 'look' and these are shown at the bottom of the screen</p>
<p>The only thing worth noting is that backspace does not work, so the left arrow key must be used. I cannot fix this with my current knowledge, but I am working on a fix</p>
<p>Also, typing a command without any parameter repeats the last parameter as nothing different is set. This could be useful for continuously going east or something as you only have to type 'move east' once, then only 'move'</p>
<h2>System requirements</h2>
<p>Currently, the game uses 20mb of RAM since the audio is placeholder and the code is very unoptimised - Code first, optimise later</p>
<p>Using the Windows 10 compatibility troubleshooter, I was able to still run the game all the way back with the Windows 95 layer, so it should work</p>
<h2>GNU/Linux version?</h2>
<p>As I have said with the optimisation, I am going to finish the game for Windows 10, then write a version for GNU/Linux. The game should run under WINE if you wish to use that</p>
<p>Also, if you are able, you can change the code to work for other Operating Systems, and post them on here</p>
<p>I have absolutely no access to an Apple Macintosh computer unless I use my Grandma's old one, so I will have to let somebody else do that for me</p>
<h2>Upcoming features</h2>
<p>Fully implement hidden rooms, audio, and fights</p>
